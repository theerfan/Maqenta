## [Magenta](https://github.com/magenta/magenta), but in Quantum.

## Roadmap
1. Learn about GANs
   * [ ] Watch [this talk by Ian Goodfellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGYYEUSm-0Q). 
   * [ ] Watch [this talk by Seth Lloyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfN8xT3Z8g).
   * [x] Go through [PennyLane's Tutorial of QuGANs](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_QGAN.html).
   * [ ] Go through [GANSynth tutorial on Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/gansynth).
   * [ ] Port GANSynth to Quantum.
2. Learn about RNNs & LSTMs 
   * [ ] Go through [RNN music generation tutorial on Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/06/10/recurrent-neural-network-generation-tutorial).
   * [ ] Port the above to Quantum.
   * [ ] Implement [Quantum Long Short-Term memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01783) in PennyLane.

3. Learn more about other QML Methods that could be possible for generating music.
   * [ ] [Quantum models as Fourier series](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_expressivity_fourier_series.html).
   * [ ] [Quanvolutional Neural Networks](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution.html).
   * [ ] [Quantum transfer learning](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning.html).
   * [ ] [Learning to learn with quantum neural networks](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/learning2learn.html).
 
 4. Learn Music Theory to be able to find even more ideas for generating Quantum Music.
    * [ ] [Music And Measure Theory - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw).
